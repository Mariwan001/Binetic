    {
        Q1: ` What It Does?`,
        Ans1: 'Protocol Flow maps out the invisible highways of digital interaction—from internal process syncs to global API requests. It decodes how devices, programs, and networks agree on how, when, and what to send.' 
    },
    {
        Q2: `Why It Matters?`,
        Ans2: 'Modern systems fail when protocols break. Binetic’s Protocol Flow gives developers, engineers, and thinkers a lens to detect weakness, optimize paths, and understand digital negotiation at its purest level.'
